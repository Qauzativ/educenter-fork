Qauzativ Cloud is a cloud-native DWH powered by Microsoft Azure ***plus***
customizable predictive models on top of it. While the focus is on credit risk,
insurance and retail use-cases, potential scope covers many industries, or
in fact any industry as long as there is sufficient data.

The database schema of QZ Cloud includes structured data that is versatile
enough to support an ERP system like Microsoft Dynamics as well as graph data,
less structured data like text to support data driven decision making with
other types of ML algorithms like network analysis and NLP.

### What problem it solves

AI / ML is embraced by the most innovative companies for a good reason:
it brings competitive advantages via cutting costs, boosting revenues,
increasing productivity, elevating customer experience but comes at a cost:

* High complexity and maintenance of the infrastructure.
  To stay up to date, not even ahead of the game in the fast-growing ecosystem
  of ML frameworks and platforms, businesses have to test new platforms,
  discontinue obsolete ones and start over again in a never-ending cycle.

* High cost of ML experts.
  Qualified data scientists are expensive and hard to find.
  Unless DSML is the primary line of business that generates products for
  customers rather than a support function behind existing operations,
  it's often more efficient to outsource that function partially.

We believe any business should be in a position to use advanced AI / ML.
There must be an option to get started without having to invest in research
and infrastructure.

It is our mission with QZ Cloud to make modern cloud-era DWH and ML tools
accessible to small, mid-size and large businesses -- as a 24x7x365 service,
at a fraction of the cost of in-house development -- turning *"Renting"* into
an alternative to the "Build vs Buy" conundrum.

### Why use it

Besides the obvious general advantages of SaaS applications such as scalability,
99.99% availability, flexible pricing & low cost of entry vs in-house opex &
upfront investment, access to state-of-the-art tools, the key reasons for
choosing QZ Cloud are Flexibility, Freedom and Focus.

#### Flexibility: customized and pre-trained models

........................ UNFINISHED TEXT

#### Freedom: you retain ownership of your data

Your company retains control and ownership of the data with at least 2 options
in case a decision is made to discontinue a QZ Cloud subscription:

* Fall back on QZ Community if your company uses it to consolidate data from
  ERP, CRM and other sources.
  While QZ Community is a stand-alone product in its own right, it can be used
  to de-personalize and export data from your local servers to QZ Cloud.

* Migrate to Azure Data Lake or Azure SQL Database, the very same components
  that QZ Cloud uses to store the data.
  Thus a migration from our database to your Azure account is a smooth process
  except for our proprietary database schema components that may not be readily
  available in standard Azure settings.

#### Focus: specialization and expertise

We are a focused company and invest a great deal of attention to detail.
Having similar clients brings similar data under one roof. A SaaS company
accumulates the knowledge based on all the customers it has worked with.
This offers the possibility to develop extra functionality that hadnâ€™t been
thought of and to fine-tune predictive models to master the specific task.

Whenever possible, we use several approaches to attain a balanced view:
classification, regression and survival analysis algorithms on binary,
numeric and time-based target variables are combined to tackle a single
task from different angles.
For example, credit risk models address several questions at once about presumed
delinquency: *whether, when, how large and how prolonged it would be*.
In certain settings we also investigate *which* outstanding loan products
are likely to be defaulted upon first.

Companies that already use DSML may find QZ Cloud services are a worthy
"second opinion" addition to their existing applications: even 1% incremental
improvement of model accuracy will bring a large reduction of bad loan losses.

### How it works

........................ UNFINISHED TEXT

........................ UNFINISHED TEXT

#### Several layers of data

Doesn't want to lock itself into a rigid proprietary DWH solution that is costly
to buy, maintain and upgrade, and believes that a flexible and extensible datawarehouse,
capable of handling dynamic dataflows of the modern age

###### #1 Business data

........................ UNFINISHED TEXT

The datawarehouse schema, based on the
[Common Data Model](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/common-data-model/),
is designed for the industry-standard customer centric data from applications
like ERP and CRM.  
The [Common Data Model, or CDM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/common-data-model/)
is an open-source collection of schemas for storing high variety and
high volume of data from business software, and is universally applicable
for building ML applications across many industries.
For example, Microsoft's `Dynamics 365` cloud-based enterprise software platform
relies on CDM for data storage.
See [CDM GitHub page](https://github.com/microsoft/CDM) and our
[FAQ](/info/faq/) for more details on CDM.

###### #2 Custom structured data

........................ UNFINISHED TEXT

In case you have unique data sources, we will customize the DWH and the models.

Has multiple sources of data from applications -- ERP, CRM, accounting
software, website, mobile apps, etc. -- and that data keeps getting bigger

###### #3 Custom unstructured data

........................ UNFINISHED TEXT

In case you have unique data sources, we will customize the DWH and the models.

#### Predictive models

pre-trained predictive models  
fine-tuned according to the customer's data and specific requirements  
custom made models  
ensembles of models: Basel and IFRS9 compliant risk assessment is built from
combinations of these models to address PD, EAD and LGD calculations.

* Apriori, Eclat, FP-growth algorithms for frequent itemset analysis
* Causality analysis (e.g. marketing campaigns)
* Deep learning based recommender systems

##### What models solve

Finance: Credit scoring; Fraud detection  
Retail: Inventory management, Sales & demand forecasting,
Market basket analysis, Customer lifetime value prediction,
Recommendation systems.  
Retail companies have diverse data usage scenarios and prediction use-cases.
We use various methods and algorithms according to specific business requirements.

Retail 

Demand prediction
Customer retention
Inventory control

Finance 

Fraud detection
Customer segmentation
Risk analysis
Customer retention


Manufacturing 

Predictive Maintenance
Anomaly Detection
Pattern analysis

###### #1 Input and output

........................ UNFINISHED TEXT

###### #2 Responsible explainable AI / ML

........................ UNFINISHED TEXT

No black boxes: **responsible explainable ML** algorithms are used to ensure
that your business decisions are backed by concise interpretation of the models' predictions.

###### #3 What is required to integrate the models

Predictive models on demand are as light-weight as can be: no need for local
servers, frameworks, applications, just standard web service output

Azure ML web services ........................

Automatic scaling with Docker & Kubernetes is provided by Azure so that
extra computing and storage capacity is paid for only when it is needed.

##### #4 Custom models

Assume 2 ML experts and 1 data engineer were hired to develop a solution
in 3 months: a DWH and a couple of models, or an ensemble of models.
Salaries very in different regions of the world; assuming $25-35K per year
gross salaries, the direct labour cost is:
> 3 * ($35K / 12 + $30K / 12 + $25K / 12) = $22.5K

With the price of $500/month for an equivalent SaaS service, thats's 45 months
worth of SaaS usership. Add indirect labour cost of other people involved,
the cost of dedicated IT infrastructure ---> the SaaS equivalent goes up to
50-65 months.

> Not only ML experts are expensive and a rare species but also finding and
> hiring the right people may be an issue.
