We operate an open source business model. Before getting paid for our cloud
products or training services, we give out free open source code that can be
useful to thousands of developers and hundreds of companies.
Here is how our free or paid products could serve your company.

***

### Qauzativ Community -- an open source DSML datamart

QZ Community will be a valuable asset in the IT infrastructure **if your company:**

* Has developers and database engineers to administer the data locally
  and deploy QZ Community as an analytics & predictive modeling datamart

* Has data scientists to build predictive models and engineers to deploy
  them ---> SQL Server that powers QZ Community is great for storing data
  and for running models in production directly on the data

* Is in lending, insurance or retail business ---> that's what the current
  edition of Qauzativ Community handles best

* Wants to put credit and insurance bureau reports to good use in
  data analytics and machine learning

to the tab above

### Qauzativ Cloud -- versatile, flexible enterprise DWH for ML

QZ Cloud caters to a broad range of use cases in large and small companies
alike, and could be the right choice **if your company:**

* Has multiple sources of data from applications -- ERP, CRM, accounting
  software, website, mobile apps, etc. -- and that data keeps getting bigger

* Doesn't want to lock itself into a rigid proprietary DWH solution that
  is costly to buy, maintain and upgrade, and believes that a flexible and
  extensible datawarehouse, capable of handling dynamic dataflows of the modern
  age, is called for

* Views data science and machine learning as a support function rather than
  a primary line of business ---> hence ready to outsource the DSML function
  in some part

* Doesn't have a sufficiently large team of engineera and data scientists to handle
  all the datawarehousing, data analytics and predictive modeling in-house

### Training = Solutions

We classify our core DSML track more as a product than a service: it follows
industry-standard data scientist curriculum.
Other training tracks are custom-tailored, like services.
For better learning experience, trainees are guided by us through multiple
practice-based projects. For a better return on your investment, at least
one of those projects delivers a solution of your choice.

**If your company:**

* Has 5+ employees to be trained into data analysts so that their business
  domain expertise becomes a valuable contribution to DSML projects
  
* Needs to upgrade the skillset of the data analysts / scientists team in
  a specific area of expertise, for example computer vision or network analysis

* Needs to develop and deploy into production some special solution(s)
  that the DSML business unit hasn't delivered yet

**[then one of our training courses may be the right match](/training)**
