### What is the Deep ML track?

The Deep ML track focuses on solving common computer vision and natural language processing tasks with deep neural network architectures using PyTorch and Keras.

***

### What trainees will learn

Trainees will solve several CV (computer vision) and NLP (natural language processing)
tasks during the training.
The curriculum of this learning track is heavily practice-driven.
The syllabus is customizable to the business requirements and background of trainees;
the tasks are set by us or mutually defined according to your requirements.

***

### What trainees will take away, i.e. the deliverables

* Python code templates for solving the tasks specified in the curriculum
* Lecture notes
* DL textbooks

***

### Pre-requisites

* Basic Python programming proficiency
* Prior experience with machine learning
* Linear algebra fundamentals

Typical background: mid-level and senior data scientists with solid background
in mathematics and programming who seek to extend their expertise and solve
CV and NLP tasks.
Development of predictive models is part of the learning track.
Specific business tasks to which the training shall be tailored are to be defined.

Light-weight versions of the Deep ML track can be customized
to match data scientists' skillsets.
The tasks to be solved as part of practice-based projects may be not as advanced but
sufficient to introduce the trainees to real-life applications of
deep neural network architectures.

***

### Why Deep learning fundamentals learning track?

Deep Learning is transforming multiple industries. This deep learning track
will help learn DL fundamentals, understand and use modern architectures and
build systems in CV and NLP.
