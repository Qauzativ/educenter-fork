> ##### _'In theory there is no difference between theory and practice. But in practice, there is.'_

***

Neither of our training programs is an online course of our own design.

As a company that invests in employees' training, simply getting them to
complete some online courses is not enough. Most courses do not teach how to
build end-to-end solutions, that's not what they are created for.

The actual desired deliverable from employees' training is getting them to
build the ML solutions that your business needs.

***

### What our training programs are

For better learning experience, trainees are guided by us through multiple
practice-based projects. For a better return on your investment, at least
one of those projects is a solution of your choice developed by trainees
with our mentorship and contribution.

Comprehensive training programs led by data science practitioners will arm
your team with the knowledge it needs to solve real-life data challenges.

* Guided workshops and seminars by ML practitioners.
  Mostly offline and on-site, mixed with a few online sessions
  of technical mentoring and Q&A

* Online courses by [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com) give the basic
  skills, guide through a broad curriculum and provide a few minor projects.

* Textbooks. We provide most popular books on the subject.
  Working through textbooks is essential for trainees' learning and future
  reference. No online course can substitute that.

* Lectures by university professors on selected DSML topics, mostly
  advanced topics like deep neural networks and supporting math.

* Final solutions, i.e. graduation projects.
  At least 2 solutions to be built besides small projects from
  online courses. Solutions of your choice and / or ours.

Please see curriculum overview at the bottom of this page.

### Why we created the training programs?

They are an extension of our products and capabilities.

A substantial share of SQL, R and Python code is freely available on our
[GitHub](https://www.github.com/Qauzativ).

##### Democratize

We believe that DSML should be technically accessible to more people than
a few math-savvy data scientists.

Teaching the fundamentals of data science and machine learning to 10 or 20
employees from different business domains is simpler and faster than making
5 data scientists experts in 10 different business domains.

##### Demystify and streamline

Rather than researching scientific papers, practical ML should be more about
putting tutorials into practice, re-using template solutions, rigorously
testing, carefully calibrating and interpreting the models.

We can not emphasize enough how efficient code re-use and boilerplate code
can be. It will eventually save hundreds of man-hours and thousands of US$
in labour costs once trainees start re-using standardized code templates that
come as part of the training.

##### Grow the talent

Talent scarcity in DSML is a major issue that will not cease in the foreseeable
future, making in-house training one of the most reasonable options.

The bottom line of our ML training, especially the "Core DSML track", is getting
your employees trained in DSML so that they contribute their new DSML skills
and existing business domain expertise along a few lines:

* Correct problem definition. *"A problem well defined is half-solved"*
* Data exploration and prototyping by them (which often take 70-80% of time)
  will save senior data scientists a lot of time and effort, lots of US$ for
  the company and faster time to production
* Project management, technical documentation, requirements management.

Prior background in computer science or math is not required for "Core DSML track".
The other training tracks, "Deep ML" and "Special ML" do require trainees
to have prior knowledge of DSML fundamentals and to be proficient at an
intermediate level in linear algebra and Python programming.
